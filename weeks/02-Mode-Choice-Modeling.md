## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:
* Agent based modeling
* Current practices for mode choice

## Reading

Please read the following:
* Read Sections 3.1  of [Activity-Based Travel Demand Models: A Primer](http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/shrp2/SHRP2_C46.pdf)
* Supplemental reading [Mode Choice Analysis Using Random Forrest Decision Trees](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146516307347)

## Replication task
* Take a look at the heart dataset ([HeartData_Full.csv](../data/HeartData_Full.csv)) and make sure you can read it into a Jupyter notebook. We'll talk about data cleaning next week, but feel free to take a first pass at exploring the data.
* You'll eventually use the scikit-learn and xgboost libraries as you build your classification model in the coming weeks. Try to install both this week so we have to troubleshoot if necessary. 

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks:

1. Read the heart data into a notebook and take a pass at exploring the data

2. Download and install scikit-learn and xgboost if you don't have them already

## Weekly Questions
Answer the folowing questions on Canvas:
* What are some examples of discrete choices that we consider in a discrete-choice model within a travel demand model?
* What is random utility maximization? How are utilities for travel modes calculated? What are some advantages and disadvantages to this approach for mode selection?
* Why are nested models and composite utilities used in mode choice modeling?
* What is the difference between a trip and a tour in an activity-based model?
