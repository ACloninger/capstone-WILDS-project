## Guidelines for writing a proposal for Q2 project

The proposal should detail various aspects of the project. 
Some details would be figured out in Q2 and some might change from the original proposal. However, most of the details should be spelled out and explained.

## Here is a first draft of project plan guidelines.

General: the goal of the project plan is to describe the learning problem at a 
level understandable to students in other capstone projects.

The authoring tools must support mathematical notation,  sectioning and imported figures.  
The recommended tool is Latex, Markdown with formula support (such as jupyter markdown) is also acceptable.
Word and plain text are discouraged,

1. Description of the learning problem:  describe, using mathematical notation what is the learning problem you aim to address. What parts of the problem are supervised? what parts are unsupervised?
2. Describe which ML algorithms you plan to use, if the algorithm is not common knowledge, describe it. Are you planning to develop your own algorithms?
3. What do you plan to implement/extend yourself and what software packages do you plan to use. Give enough details for others to replicate.
4. What data do you plan to use, give enough details for others to replicate.
5. What performance measures are you planning to use? What alternative algorithms do you plan to compare with?  How would you know if your method does not work?
