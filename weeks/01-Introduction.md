# Introduction

## Topics
- Intro to problem
- Intro to decision trees
- Intro to transport

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:
-  Reading the first two entires in OT and in Trees will help familiarize you with the problem and basic techniques
-  Run the code on color image adaptation that's provided in OT for ML (and in the Py OT codebase)
-  Run the code for random forests in sklearn.

## Reading

Please read the following:
- the first two entires in OT and the two entries in Trees (under Resources)

## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions
- What type of domain adaptation is the color image change example given in OT for ML?
- Do you think color shift of images is a linear or nonlinear process in practice?
- Why do random forests use a randomly chosen subset of the features when learning each node?
- In classification problems, the usual way to combine the outputs of the trees is to find the plurality (how is plurality different from majority?) Suppose your goal is to output a set containing, potentially, more than one class. How would you approach this problem?
