# Partial Transport and Differing Densities

## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:

* What do we do when the proportion of classes differs for different data sets?
* How do we do partial transport?
* If we knew or estimated label proportions, could we define a transport that was invariant to these percentages?

## Reading

Please read the following:

* Look through [Transport under Target Shift - JCPOT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04899.pdf)
* Look through [Unbalanced Transport](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.05816.pdf)

## Replication task

* Adjust the densities of your gaussians and redo the experiment with partial transport


## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions

* How would one cross-validate the partial transport hyperparameter weighting?
* Given that we know the estimated labels from the decision tree, can we incorporate them into JCPOT as estiamtes of the labels?
