# Sinkhorn transport

## Reading

Please read the following:

* Read Sinkhorn transport paper by Cuturi [here](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/af21d0c97db2e27e13572cbf59eb343d-Paper.pdf)

## Replication task

* Prepare data sets for replication / experiment:
** three classes of gaussians, with different instances when you've applied small shifts, rescalings, different densities, and other perturbations
** collection of images for image data set to image data set transfer



## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions

* What would happen in transport if the densities of the different classes changed?
* How would this manifest in image data?  Can you give another example where this would be an issue?
