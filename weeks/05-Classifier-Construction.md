# Classifier Construction

## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:

* How to build and begin evaluating an XGBoost classifier

## Reading

Please read the following:

* Read Sections 3.2 and 3.3 of [An optimized XGBoost based diagnostic system for effective prediction of heart disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319157820304936)
* Supplemental reading [How to Develop Your First XGBoost Model in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-first-xgboost-model-python-scikit-learn/)

## Replication task

* Build an XGBoost classifer using the cleaned heart data (don't worry about parameter tuning for now)
* Explore the outputs of the trained model
* Calculate evaluation metrics as the authors do. Take a look at model accuracy, sensitivity, etc.


## Tasks

Complete the following tasks:

* Complete the reading
* Build a classifier and calculate several evaluation metrics


## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions

* Why do we need to split our data into testing and training sets? 
* We don't always put as much weight on certain metrics as others. When would we care more about sensitivity? When would we care more about precision?
* In your own words, describe what a ROC curve is and why it's useful. What is AUC and what does it tell us?
