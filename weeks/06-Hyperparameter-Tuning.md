# Hyperparameter Tuning

## Topics

This week's assignments will guide you through the following topics:

* Model hyperparameters
* Hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimization 

## Reading

Please read the following:

* Read Sections Sections 2.4, 2.5, and 3.2 of [An optimized XGBoost based diagnostic system for effective prediction of heart disease](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319157820304936)
* Supplemental Reading [Bayesian Optimization of xgBoost](https://www.kaggle.com/nanomathias/bayesian-optimization-of-xgboost-lb-0-9769)

## Replication task

* Starting with your trained XGBoost model, tune the nine hyperparameters the authors mention using a Bayesian Optimization approach
* Document your approach and reasoning in a clear and consise way


## Tasks

Complete the following tasks:

* Read the specified sections in the Optimized XGBoost paper
* Incorporate a hyperparameter tuning step to your model construction workflow
* Evaluate your tuned model and compare to the original to gauge improvement


## Weekly Questions

Answer the following questions

* What are the differences between model parameters and hyperparameters?
* In your own words, discuss why we might be interested in modifying (tuning) hyperparameters?
* What is Bayesian Optimization and how does it differ from manual or grid search approaches to hyperparameter tuning?
