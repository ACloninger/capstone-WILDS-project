# Why are Ensembles Stable?
We will study the dolor distributions that arise from sattelite images in africa and argue that the distribution, rather than the 2D features hold most of the information for tasks such as estimating poverty. We will also discuss why this representation is a better fit for Boosting than for DNNs.

We will then consider a tree-based approach for comparing distributions.

If time permits, we will also discuss the problem of Optimal transport using the tree representation for the distribution.
